# wif-weave

`wif-weave` is a parsing utility built on [configparser](https://crates.io/crates/configparser) to parse `.wif`
files used for representing weaving patterns. The `.wif` specification was originally created in 1996, and has been
stable at [1.1](http://www.tantradharma.com/maplehill/wif/wif1-1.txt) since 1997. While many weaving programs have
their own proprietary formats, nearly all can export to and import from `.wif` files.
